Web Components
===============

Web Components are a new browser feature that provides a standard component model for the Web, consisting of several pieces:

- [Shadow DOM](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/)
    - [The current issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues).
    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14978) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.
    - It has been a long-term goal to upstream the Shadow DOM spec into the [DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).
- [Custom Elements](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
    - [The current issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/custom-elements).
    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14968) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used
- [HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)
    - [The issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=20683) on W3C bugzilla.
- HTML Templates
    - HTML Templates were upstreamed into the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element).
